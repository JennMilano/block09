        <p class="abouttext">
            I'm the proud mom of two toddlers who are basically tiny, unpredictable tornadoes in human form. 
            My days are filled with negotiating snack choices and finding lost pacifiers. When they're not 
            tackling each other like mini NFL players, practicing their golf swing in the kitchen, or sneaking 
            snacks from the pantry, they're showering me with love in the form of high fives and knucks.

        <p class="abouttext">
            I discovered golf during the pandemic—mainly as a way to escape the monotony of lockdown life and maybe
            avoid one more Zoom call. What started as ‘just hitting balls for fun’ quickly turned into a full-blown
            obsession. I’ve traded in my ‘I just hope I can hit it’ attitude for something closer to ‘Think I can
            drive the green?’

        <p class="abouttext">Sports are my love language. From traveling the country as a player, my days working in pro sports, to weekend fantasy leagues, 
            I’ve been lucky enough to experience the game from every angle. But now, the real game has begun: I’m 
            gearing up to get my toddlers into the action! Between coaching them on the art of kicking balls and 
            prepping for future family leagues, I can’t wait to pass on my love for sports. I may be outnumbered by 
            tiny humans at home, but when it comes to game time, I'm all about teamwork, hustle, and a little healthy 
            competition. Let the next generation of athletes begin!
